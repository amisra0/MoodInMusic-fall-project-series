Welcome to the Spotify Mood In Music project, where one can see what their Spotify top tracks say about their mood.

Base on a user's most listened to tracks on Spotify, their mood is calculated and displayed on a scale of 1-10 over three separate time periods, as well as additional audio features of user's top tracks.

In order to use this app on your local machine, register an app on developer.spotify.com (app name can be anything).
Then, once you receive a clientId and clientSecret, paste that into the files where clientId and clientSecret is needed.
Then, add localhost:3000 to list of URLs on developer.spotify.com

Once all changes are saved, cd into client/server and type in "node server.js" in your terminal.
Then, in a new terminal, cd into client and type in "npm start" and log into to the application using your Spotify account to view your mood in music!
